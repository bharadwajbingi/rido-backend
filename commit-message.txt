fix(build): configure Kotlin JVM target to match Java toolchain version

- Added explicit Kotlin JVM target configuration (JVM_21) in gateway build.gradle.kts
- This fixes "Cannot inline bytecode built with JVM target 17 into bytecode 
  that is being built with JVM target 1.8" compilation error
- Kotlin compiler was defaulting to JVM 1.8 without explicit configuration
- Now matches Java toolchain version 21 for consistency

Testing:
- All 8 test scripts passed successfully in WSL
- Security context propagation: PASSED
- JWT validation (all invalid token scenarios): PASSED
- Refresh token rotation: PASSED
- Refresh token hashing verification (via Docker PostgreSQL): PASSED
- Key rotation admin controls: PASSED
- End-to-end secure flows: PASSED

Impact:
- Gateway module now builds successfully without JVM target mismatch errors
- All services compile with consistent JVM target (21)
- Full test suite validates authentication and security functionality

Breaking Changes: None
